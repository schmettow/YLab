# YLab is your Lab

[Getting started with YLab](https://schmettow.github.io/YLab/)

The goal of YLab is to create an educational platform to learn about physiological measure and sensors arrays.
The idea is to create a low budget software/hardw3are platform, that allows students to own their devices.

The platform can be used to teach students all about collecting, analysing and interpreting physiological data, like EDA or EMG. At the same time it offers a way to teach students programming in a fun and easy way.

YLab is based on a Raspberry Pico (not Pi), that sits on a Maker Pi board with additional components and Grove interfaces. The sensors are mainly from the Grove collection.
